Derby is an arcade demolition derby racing game. You can either win by racing legitimately or by 
destroying every other vehicle. Each vehicle has its own custom physics defined, meaning some vehicles
will have much better handling than others. Win a race legitimately or waste other vehicles by 
running into them and win by default!

Derby is *still* in early development and uses Unity's preview of the Entity Component System, 
so stay tuned for more details!

Some of the tools/modules being worked on throughout the development of this game are:

* [SplineTools](https://github.com/psuong/SplineTools)
* [Math-Utils](https://github.com/psuong/math-utils)
