## Published Projects ##

### Dani AI ###
Dani AI is a node based editor to help design and prototype AI in Unity. Each AI designed and built using Dani AI
follows a neural network like schema and attempts to treat each agent as an organism with senses that update in
realtime.

Senses provide natural information about the simulated world and hook into decisions, where the agent executes a series
of authored actions from the user. Dani AI is currently used in Ian Cheng's Emissary in the Squat of Gods art exhibit!

You can grab it here on the [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/dani-ai-108309)

### Unity Editor Tool Bag ###
The Unity Editor Tool Bag provides common decorates for Unity's Inspector to visually enhance the visual capabilities.
These visual capabilities currently provide:

* Progress Bars
* Static Message Infos, Warnings and Errors
* Dynamic/Togge-able Message Infos, Warnings and Errors

The project is open sourced and is actively worked on when I have free time. You can grab it on
[Github](https://github.com/InitialPrefabs/UnityEditorToolBag)!

## Referencable Projects ##
Referencable projects are projects which I have pulled out of games I've worked on. While they have some 3rd party
dependencies and won't compile without those dependencies, you can certainly view them for learning material.

## Arcade Vehicle Controller ##
The project is currently dated but provides an example of how to create an arcade vehicle controller in a **Data Oriented Tech Stack**.
There are design plans I currently have in place to upgrade and support Unity's new Data Oriented Physics Integration and to
rebuilt the module from the ground up.
