I graduated from City College of New York with a Bachelors in Science in Computer Science. I am an avid game developer
highly interested in

 * Optimizations and high performance computing
 * Game AI
 * Computer Graphics

I've built a bunch of small workflow tools within Unity and are opened source on Github. Feel free to take a look at
various tools I built [here](https://github.com/psuong).

## My Work
I **founded** my own development studio, [initialPrefabs](https://initialprefabs.com), where I primarily do:

* Game Development
* Creating custom solutions to help other studios and companies build their products/technical demos
* Create and release open source tools based on my own development cycle working on Cart√© Diem

I also do video work and write technical scripts to help explain libraries and frameworks for new users with [Thousand Ant](http://thousandant.com/).
