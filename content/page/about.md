I graduated from City College of New York with a Bachelors in Science in Computer Science. I am an avid game developer
highly interested in

 * Optimizations and high performance computing
 * Computer Graphics
 * Game AI

I've built a bunch of small workflow tools within Unity and are opened source on Github. Feel free to take a look at
various tools I built [here](https://github.com/psuong).

## My Work
I **founded** my own development studio, [initialPrefabs](https://initialprefabs.com), where I primarily do:

* Game Development consultation
  * Creating custom solutions to help other studios and companies build their products/technical demos
* Create and release open source tools based on my own development cycle for internal production

I am also a **technical writer**, writing technical documents and scripts in a digestible fashion. Some clients I've worked 
with include:

* [Genvid Technologies](https://www.genvidtech.com)
* [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com)

For more information about work I've done, please check out the Thousand Ant page linked [here](/work/thousandant).
