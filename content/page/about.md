I graduated from City College of New York with a Bachelors in Science in Computer Science. I am an avid game developer
highly interested in

 * Optimizations and high performance computing
 * Game AI
 * Computer Graphics

I've built a bunch of small workflow tools within Unity and are opened source on Github. Feel free to take a look at
various tools I built [here](https://github.com/psuong).
