So I've been busy these past few months working on a game tech demo that will be released in the coming months. Between 
that and juggling working on my own game, and taking care of myself, there's barely any time for me to play games. Typically, 
I'll try to reserve a few hours over the weekends to play some games - but it's got me thinking a lot about the length of 
the game.

## My Buyers Mentality ##

So before I get into some thoughts about how long a game should be - I want to delve into some of my own habits when deciding 
to purchase a game.

Typically, like most consumers I have a preference for sales and I have to really justify if a game which is over my 
preferential price range is worth it. Factors I consider when justifying buying a game typically includes (in order of 
important):

* Price
  * Is self explanatory, the cheaper a game is the less of an impact it has on your wallet.
* Length of content
  * If a game has a lot of content, then it might be worth the amount of money you intend to put into it.
* Type of game
  * If the game is in a similar genre as the ones I typically enjoy, then this game is worth looking into.
* Size of the game
  * I would rather download 2 gigs instead of 20 gigs. It takes less time to download and won't take up so much space. :)

Now this is all standard and I imagine many people would go through the same process when buying a game, but these reasons tend 
to get a bit muddy for me personally nowadays.

With limited time to play over the week and working on games, it's nice to step away from doing anything with games. So, 
I have to ask myself, 

> What am I looking for within a game?

The biggest concern I have nowadays is the # of hours of content I would have to play. If for example, you can put in 100 hours 
into a game, over long stretches of actual time without losing context of what to do when you jump back on it after a month, 
then I personally think the game is definitely worth buying.

For example, one of my most favorite games is Monster Hunter World (MHW). The game design of MHW is quite simple:

1. You hunt monsters
2. You get pieces of the monster you hunted
3. You build equipment to help you fight stronger monsters

Even after x or so months of not playing it - it's very easy to get back into, as the game is extremely linear and sandboxy.

## Variable Game Lengths (Figure out)

This had me thinking about variable game lengths. We typically reward players who put a lot of time into a game, but for 
those who don't have a lot of time to invest in the said game, it would be nice if there was a way to reward players.
