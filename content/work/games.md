Emissary the Sunsets the Self is the final episode in Ian Cheng's Emissary's trilogy, which follows 
a civilization's relationship with a sentient slime like creature. The episode was built in Unity 
where I primarily worked on developing a utility theory based AI.

The project was first released and shown at Museum of Modern Art in 2017.

Bag of Beliefs is another art exhibit and game, where attendees can interact with a sentient create 
called BOB. BOB uses exhibit provided phones to allow attendees to interact with it in order to receive 
acceleromter and motion data and determine how the attendede is interactign with it. I worked on 
optimizing the runtime and building the infrastructure to enable teammates to focus on building 
BOB's AI.

The project was first released and shown at the Gladstone Gallery in 2018.

Kart Microgame is Unity's beginner template for an arcade racing game. I helped developed this for 
Unity via Thousand Ant in order to bring gameplay updates to the kart vehicle physics, provide the 
initial ML Agents template for new users, and to optimize the game for mobile WebGL.

The project was officially upgraded at the end of 2019.

## Kung Fu Kickball (Released){#kfk}

Kung Fu Kickball is a multiplayer fighting sports game where the goal is to score the most points 
by kicking the ball into your goal. In order to help Whalefood Games potentially compensate for a 
lack of players online, I helped them train an agent to introduce competitive bots instead of 
building a classical experts based AI system (State Machine/Decision Trees). 

The research to train the AI was primarily based on the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06230.pdf).

Kung Fu Kickball is recently released as of 2021.

Inwards is a VR game about exploring your choices. Most of my work with Inwards involve creating custom 
workflow tools for teammates and optimizing the current rendering stack in order to improve performance.
